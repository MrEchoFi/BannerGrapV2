# Deacription:
BannerGrap V2 is a powerful, modular, and extensible Go-based security scanner designed for advanced reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment across a wide range of network services.
It combines classic banner grabbing with active vulnerability probing, CVE/exploit matching, brute force stubs, and reporting, making it a valuable tool for penetration testers, red teamers, and defenders.

# ### Key Features:
# Red Team (Offensive Security) Uses:
<p>
 Reconnaissance & Enumeration:
Quickly map out all live hosts, open ports, and running services across a target network.
 
Vulnerability Discovery:
Automatically detect outdated, misconfigured, or vulnerable software (Ex:, Apache, Nginx, SSH, FTP, etc.) using banner analysis and CVE matching.

Active Exploitation Probing:
Use built-in probes (Heartbleed, Shellshock, Log4Shell) to safely check for critical vulnerabilities.

Brute Force Attacks:
Attempt SSH brute force with custom or well-known username/password lists to identify weak credentials and gain initial access.

Attack Surface Mapping:
Identify hidden admin panels, anonymous FTP, and other risky exposures for further exploitation.

Automated Reporting:
Generate structured reports (JSON, CSV, HTML) for documentation, pivoting, or sharing with the team.
</p>

# Blue Team (Defensive Security) Uses:
<p>
 Asset Inventory:
Continuously scan internal and external networks to maintain an up-to-date inventory of all exposed services and their versions.
 
Vulnerability Management:
Detect and prioritize patching of vulnerable software before attackers can exploit them.

Credential Hygiene:
Test for weak or default SSH credentials across the environment to enforce strong authentication policies.

Exposure Monitoring:
Identify accidental exposures (Ex: open admin panels, anonymous FTP, legacy protocols) and reduce the attack surface.

Incident Response:
Use the tool during or after a breach to quickly assess what services and vulnerabilities were exposed.

Compliance & Audit:
Provide evidence of regular scanning and vulnerability management for compliance frameworks (PCI, HIPAA, etc.).
</p>

# Support:
Multi-Protocol Support:
Scan HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP/2, WebSocket, FTP, SMTP, SSH, Telnet, and more.

Banner Grabbing:
Collects service banners and fingerprints for rapid identification.

Signature-Based Vulnerability Detection:
Detects 50+ popular server products and flags known vulnerable versions.

Active Probes:
Includes safe, practical stubs for Heartbleed, Shellshock, and Log4Shell detection.

CVE/Exploit DB Integration:
Matches banners to known CVEs using regex and can be extended for real DB integration.

Brute Force & Enumeration Stubs:
Framework for credential brute forcing and service enumeration.

Reporting:
Outputs results in JSON, CSV, and HTML formats for easy integration and sharing.

Concurrency:
Fast, multi-threaded scanning for large-scale assessments.

Extensible:
Plugin system and modular codebase for easy feature expansion.


# How It Helps in the Cyber World:

Penetration Testing:
Quickly identifies exposed and vulnerable services across networks.

Red Team Operations:
Automates reconnaissance and initial access vector discovery.

Blue Team/Defensive Security:
Assists in asset inventory, vulnerability management, and attack surface reduction.

Education & Research:
Teaches protocol analysis, vulnerability detection, and Go security programming.
